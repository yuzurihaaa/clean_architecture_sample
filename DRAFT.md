1. Do we want user to able to add more than one wifi?
2. Are we going to do storage?
3. Will the app has capabilities to add more than one WIFI?

## Proposal.
1. A screen to show inside / outside.
2. A button that will open another screen. Screen contain:
    1. Input WIFI Name.
    2. Map for pinning location
    3. Set geofence radius.
    4. Save button
3. Save button will add to list (storage) and first one is default. This will close the 2nd screen.
4. Listen to connected wifi / current location.
5. Show status.

## Problem
1. Does pinning location start from current location?
2. Geofence (Never tried this before)
3. UX on user to expand / shrink geofence area.
